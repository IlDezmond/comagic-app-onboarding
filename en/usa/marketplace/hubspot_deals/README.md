   - As you add a credentials and choose it you could start mapping call properties to Hubspot Deal properties.
3. Set the mapping **"Call property"** to **"Deal property"**. (if you have not found properties, probably you haven't created one. [Creating properties doc](https://knowledge.hubspot.com/crm-setup/manage-your-properties))
